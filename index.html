                <hr/>
                <p>Buncom lies to the southwest of Medford in southern Oregon. It was first settled
                in 1852 after the discovery of gold near Jacksonville. The name is thought to come from
                the way many Chinese settlers in the area pronounced a white settlers name. However,
                in 1918 the post office that was established just 22 years earlier as the gold ran out.
                Many of the remaining settlers moved to Jacksonville and Medford nearby. Few old houses
                and the post office still stand.</p>

                <h2>Narrows</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>The ghost town of Narrows sits just south of Burns in southeastern Oregon. It was named for its geographical
                location between two lakes, Malheur containing freshwater and Harney which is undrinkable. One of its first settlers,
                    Charles A. Haines, hoped to establish a cattle ranch between the two lakes and built his house there. It became a popular resting place
                    between Burns to the north and Frenchglen to the south. However, when the road between the two was paved, travelers no longer found
                    it necessary to stop in Narrows, and the town's population declined. The demise was finalized when the town hotel burned to the ground.

                <h2>New Era</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>New Era is a ghost town in western Clackamas County, a surprisingly urban setting for a ghost town. The ghost town sits between current day Oregon City and Canby, which are both
                active towns with 36,000 and 17,500 people respectively. A post office was established in
                    the area in the 1850s, however the origin of the name "New Era" is unclear. Many sources incorrectly
                    cite the New Era Spiritualist Camp established in 1873, but the religious group came after
                    the name of the town. Settlers were drawn to the town because of the abundance of water due
                    to numerous streams in the area which allowed for industrial growth. To add to the mystery of its origins,
                its decline is just as nebulous; the post office closed in 1940 without reason (according to sources).</p>

                <h2>Peak</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>Peak is a ghost town near Marys Peak in Benton County. White settlers came to the area and established the community
                    in 1898 with a post office, a school, a church, and cedar shingle mill that provided
                    income for the community. The post office closed down in 1917 after the construction of
                    a highway from Corvallis to Newport that bypassed the town. Now, only a cemetery with 12
                    graves survives.

                <h2>Bohemia City</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>Bohemia City was a mining town in the southern Cascade Range. A Czech immigrant
                    James "Bohemia" Johnson, the namesake of the town, discovered gold in the area in
                    1863. The settlement of Bohemia City and a gold mine were established in 1886.
                    The now ghost town is situated in the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia_mining_district">Bohemia Mining District</a>,
                    the most productive mining area in the Western Cascades.
                    Currently, a few buildings and dilapidated mining equipment remain.
