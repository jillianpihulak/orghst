# Ghost Towns in Oregon

The storyline of this particular story map includes eight small stories. Each scene covers a ghost town in Oregon, that was once teeming with people and has since grown vacant. These mini stories follow a pretty standard story format, with an exposition, a conflict, and a resolution. However, in the case of a city's birth and decline, these stories will be simplified as each situation would have its own series of issues that can be very complex.
